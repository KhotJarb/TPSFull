## 📖 Overview

**Thailand Political Simulation (TPS)** is a standalone, browser-based political strategy game built entirely in vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools, no installation required. Open `index.html` and play.

You begin as a rising political figure navigating the treacherous landscape of Thai politics. Lead your party through an 8-week national campaign, win seats in the House of Representatives, survive live parliamentary debates, form a governing coalition — or, if you fail, lead the opposition and fight your way back to power in an infinite political cycle.

**v1.0.2.5** introduces **real-time peer-to-peer multiplayer**, allowing 2-8 players to compete head-to-head in the Campaign module with synchronized turns, interactive coalition negotiations, and live chat.

## 🆕 NEW in v1.0.2.5 — "Multiplayer Test"

### 🌐 Real-Time P2P Multiplayer Campaign

The headline feature of v1.0.2.5. Up to 8 players compete in the same Campaign module in real-time using **PeerJS WebRTC** for direct browser-to-browser communication — no server required.

#### Lobby & Party Selection
- **Create or Join Rooms** — Host generates a 6-character room code; joiners enter the code to connect.
- **Custom Party Creator** — Design your own party with custom name, color, ideology, and regional base.
- **Exclusive Party Lock** — Each party can only be selected by one player. Selections sync in real-time.
- **Ready Check** — All players must ready up before the host can start the campaign.
- **Difficulty & Balance Settings** — Host configures difficulty and balance mode for the session.

#### Synchronized Campaign
- **Turn Barrier System** — "Next Day", "Hold General Election", and "Proceed to Coalition" buttons all require **all players** to press before the action proceeds. A live counter shows `Waiting... (2/4)` progress.
- **Polls & Map Sync** — National poll shares and the D3.js electoral map update across all clients after each day advance.
- **Parliament Majority Vote** — When a Parliament day occurs, all players vote "Enter" or "Ignore". The majority decision applies to everyone. Minority voters receive a stat penalty.
- **Shared State Persistence** — All MP session data persists in `localStorage` across module transitions (Campaign ↔ Parliament).

#### Player-Only Elections (No AI Parties)
- In multiplayer, **only player-selected parties** compete in the election.
- All 500 seats are distributed exclusively among human players based on polls and performance.
- AI parties are completely excluded from election results, coalition offers, and seat calculations.
- Single-player mode is unaffected — all 5 parties compete as before.

#### Interactive Coalition Negotiation
The old AI willingness system is replaced with a fully interactive, turn-based P2P negotiation:

```
1st Place Party → Formation Leader (2 attempts max)
  ├─ Select parties to invite (checkbox UI)
  ├─ Send invitations → invited players see Accept/Reject
  ├─ If coalition ≥ 251 seats → COALITION FORMED ✅
  ├─ If < 251 seats → Attempt 2 (retry with new selections)
  └─ If both attempts fail → Turn passes to 2nd place
2nd Place Party → Same 2-attempt process
  └─ If all attempts fail → MINORITY GOVERNMENT ⚖️
```

| Player Role | Screen |
|------------|--------|
| **Formation Leader** | Checkbox selection of parties + "Send Invitations" button |
| **Invited Player** | Accept / Reject prompt with leader's party info |
| **Other Player** | Waiting screen with live status updates |

#### Post-Coalition Routing

| Outcome | Coalition Members | Non-Members |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Coalition Formed** | → Victory → Government | → Opposition |
| **Minority Government** | Leader → Government | → Opposition |

#### 💬 Real-Time Chat System
- **Cross-Module Persistence** — Chat works across Campaign, Parliament, and all module transitions.
- **Self-Injecting Architecture** — The chat module auto-injects a floating action button (💬) and slide-out drawer on every page.
- **Separate PeerJS Channel** — Uses a dedicated `CHAT_` peer ID prefix, independent of the game coordinator.
- **System Messages** — Game events (EC Red Flag penalties, etc.) are broadcast as system messages visible to all players.
- **Unread Badge** — Shows unread count when the chat drawer is closed.
- **100-Message History** — Messages persist in `localStorage` and survive page navigation.

#### Room & Session Management
- **Leave Room** — Players can leave at any time; their data is wiped from the session.
- **Host Disconnect** — If the host leaves, all players are notified and redirected to the main menu with full data wipe.
- **Force Wipe** — Host leaving triggers a `force_wipe` broadcast to clean all clients.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes in v1.0.2.5

| Bug | Resolution |
|-----|------------|
| "Next Day" button stuck on "Waiting" with 1 player | Host self-evaluates barrier immediately |
| "Skip to Weekend" button appearing in multiplayer | Hidden when `_isMultiplayer` is true |
| Poll data not saving after Parliament return (MP) | `saveCampaignState()` called before module transition |
| Affiliation showing "Loading..." in MP | Party selection synced via `tps_mp_party_selections` |
| National Polls resetting after Parliament (MP) | Polls persisted to `localStorage` and restored on return |
| Parliament popup not using majority vote system | Replaced with majority vote: all players vote → majority decides |
| "Ignore" button inconsistent styling on repeat days | Unified button state reset on each Parliament day |
| EC Red Flag penalty not appearing in MP | Added `_checkAndShowGuillotine()` to MP day-advanced handler |
| Campaign "New Game" bypassing party select in loop mode | Detects `tps_campaign_loop` flag and skips party select |
| Election results including AI parties in MP | `_getElectionParties()` filters to player-only parties |

### ⚖️ Minor Balance Adjustments (pre-MP)

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| EC Red Flag poll penalty | Nerfed from -5% to **-2.5%** |
| Fundraise trust penalty | Shows warning toast when scrutiny reduces yield |
| Capital-driven influence regen | High capital (75+) grants +20 influence/week |
| Rest day scrutiny drift | Small random ±1 scrutiny on rest days (30% chance) |
